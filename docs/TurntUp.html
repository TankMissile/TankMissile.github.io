		<p class="sectiontitle">Summary</p>
		<p>
			Turnt Up is a class project music-oriented vertical-scrolling space shooter.  My role in this project was as the Gameplay Engineer, but I had a major hand in all aspects of design and development: Gameplay, AI, UI, Art, Music, Sounds, Bullet/Enemy/Boss Design, etc.  This project received the class award for Best Music, and most reviews said that it looked the most fun to play.

		<p class="sectiontitle">How To Play</p>
		<p>
			Your ship will automatically fire as notes are played in the current song, but different types of notes will have different bullets. <br />
			<b style="color:red">Red explosions:</b> In time with Bass kicks.  These are your most powerful weapons, but are also very short range.  They are unaffected by the number of targets they pierce. <br />
			<b style="color:red">Red Waves:</b> In time with harmony notes, they travel forward and pierce through all enemies in their path.  These are weaker than the explosions, but are still very useful for clearing groups of enemies. <br />
			<b style="color:green">Green, Curving projectiles:</b> In time with Hi-Hats, these shots are weak but penetrate through three targets and generally fire very rapidly. <br />
			<b style="color:blue">Blue, Straight-flying projectiles:</b> In time with Snares and Melody notes, these hit one target for respectable damage, and cycle firing direction.  They are good for clearing out sparse waves of enemies. <br />
			<b style="color:grey">Rockets:</b> In time with Bass notes, these choose a random target upon being fired and home in relentlessly.  They deal respectable damage and are guaranteed to hit, but are unpredictable and generally do not fire very often. <br />

		<p class="subsectiontitle">Keyboard Controls: </p>
		<p>
			Move with WASD<br />
			Shooting is performed automatically, in time with the music.  Which bullets will be fired next can be seen on the rhythm bar at the bottom right of the screen.<br />
			Hold Space to hold the ship still and aim left and right
		</p>
		
		<p class="subsectiontitle">Gamepad Controls:</p>
		<p>
			Left stick to move<br />
			B on an xbox controller to hold still<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			There are four levels, but Sandstorm is incomplete.  I highly recommend the Infinity level, as it is the most engaging and does not use music composed by a third party. 
			However, it is also very difficult.  If you have trouble, the FF Boss 2 level is a good warm-up.<br />
			The game is designed so that losing is impossible, but every time you die your score is halved.
			If you get a high score your name will appear only as DEV, but your score will still be recorded in the table.<br />
			The settings menu is currently nonfunctional.
