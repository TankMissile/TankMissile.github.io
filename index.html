						<p>Turnt Up was a class project for my Video Game Design class in 2015.  It is a music-oriented, vertical-scrolling space shooter made in the Unity engine.  
						The game is played by moving a space ship in a 2D environment in order to avoid enemies and line up shots.  The player's attacks are fired automatically 
						based on cues in the level's background music, which are read from a MIDI file.  This project received the class award for Best Music, and peer reviews 
						complimented it for looking the most fun to play. More info can be found <a href="./docs/TurntUp.html">here</a>.</p>

						<p>Pandemic was a class project aimed at writing up a project description using UML standards.
						The project itself is a design for a smartphone game using location services to create a fictional warzone between two opposing factions. 
						The first, BioHydra, focused on spreading viruses as a form of bioterrorism.  The other, VacSect, focused on stopping those viruses in their tracks.  Players could 
						choose which faction to play for, and would have a different experience depending on which faction they joined.  Read a more detailed summary

						<p>Simple Box Game (SBG) was originally meant to be for practice using threads, but I enjoyed working on it and decided to keep developing forward.
						It is a 2D platformer designed around mobility, and uses a tile-based layout for level design.  It has a level editor which I used to
						create the playable level.  However, since the game's graphics were made using Java's Swing interface, and because it employs threads
						rampantly, the game slows down quickly as more enemies are added to the level.  For this reason, I later redesigned the game using the Unity3D engine.
						For more info, read <a href="./docs/SimpleBoxGame.pdf">here</a>, or read about the Unity version below.</p>

						<p>The Unity version of SBG was a summer project aimed to remake the original in order to be playable with larger levels and more enemies.
						It employs many of the same mechanics, with a speedy stair climb ability and a horizontal dash.  Additionally, it experiments with different
						lighting and camera styles, the latter of which enables more user customization for an individual experience.  For more information, read

						<p>Virtual Reality Testing was a Unity project made for the Oculus Rift, as a weekend project for HackIllinois 2015.  It uses the virtual reality
						interface to make a private testing environment, which prevents both cheating and distractions for the test taker. It features the ability to 
						<a href="http://searchfilter.web.engr.illinois.edu/">make a test form on its web page,</a> which can then be distributed to a class setup of Oculus Rifts.
						In the application, the form is converted into a series of multiple choice questions, one per page, the options to which are selected by looking at them in the Rift
						and left clicking.  When the test is complete, it will collect the student's responses to the questions into a file and email it to the instructor.  If you'd like to
						see more, view the HackIllinois submission writeup <a href="/docs/VRT.pdf">here.</a></p>
