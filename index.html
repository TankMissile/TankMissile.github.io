						<p>Turnt Up is a class project music-oriented vertical-scrolling space shooter.  The game is played by moving a space ship in a 2D environment
						in order to avoid enemies and line up shots.  The player's attacks are fired automatically based on cues in the level's background music, which
						are read from a MIDI file.  This project received the class award for Best Music, and peer reviews complimented it for looking fun to play.

						<p>Pandemic was a class project aimed at writing up a project description using UML standards.
						The project itself is a design for a smartphone game using location services to create a fictional warzone between two opposing factions, 
						one focused on spreading viruses as a form of bioterrorism, and the other focused on stopping those viruses in their tracks.  Players could 
						choose which faction to play on, and would have a different experience depending on which faction they joined.  Read a more detailed summary

						<p>Simple Box Game (SBG) was originally just meant to be for practice using threads, but I enjoyed working on it and decided to keep developing
						beyond.  It is a 2D platformer designed around mobility, and uses a tile-based layout for level design.  It has a level editor which I used to
						create the playable level.  However, since the game's graphics were made naively using Java's Swing interface and because it employs threads
						rampantly, the game slows down quickly as more enemies are added to the level.  For this reason, I later redesigned the game using the Unity3D engine.
						For more info on the Java versin, read <a href="./docs/SBG_Java.pdf">here</a>, or read about the Unity version below.</p>
